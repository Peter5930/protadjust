==========

- Plain prot armour no longer protects against damage types other than melee.  Against other damage types, it only counts as vanilla diamond armour.

-  The damage from poison has been rebalanced so that it deals approximately the same damage in all situations as it used to deal against prot IV.

-  The damage from explosions has been buffed (currently doubled) so that a point blank TNT detonation will kill a person who's not in blast prot.

-  Arrow dispensers have been buffed so that they're equivalent to power V flame I bows.

-  Arrow dispensers have been buffed so that they fire arrows at a velocity 3.5 times higher than previously, increasing the range of a dispenser placed at head height from 13 blocks to 40 blocks.

-  When damage is recieved from attacking a person wearing thorns armour, it results in wither I for 150 ticks.  (Going to need a lot of combat testing to balancing this)

Known issues:

-  Lava isn't doing as much damage as it should to players in prot.
-  Config doesn't have options for changing the status effect, duration and amplitude of effect from thorns damage.
